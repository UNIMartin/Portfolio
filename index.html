					All my life I've been drawing, painting and creating things to both fuel and use my creative mind.
					<br><br>
					I have a constant desire to create and design, and I always get really creatively motivated whenever I start on a new project.
					<br><br>
					Whenever I get a spark of inspiration I start a new creative project, and there isn't a creative field that I haven't explored and loved, but there is no arguing that I always have and always will come back to Graphic Design.
					<br><br>
					I have worked in many different fields of content creation for years now - both making commercials, posters, social media posts, online marketing, websites, newsletters, animations, logos and mascots for a handful of different companies - but I've always stayed true to my roots in graphic design, my love for color theory and my desire to make every product just right.
					<br><br>
					When I was 13 years old I had my first digital drawing made in Adobe Illustrator printed in a manga (Naruto volume 37 (Carlsen Manga)), and that accomplishment really pushed my motivation to create things even further.
					<br><br>
					My dream job is with a company that challenges my creative mind and let's me create things that I can look back at and be proud of.

					I actively work with the whole Adobe pack on every project, be it pictures, videos, animations, drawings, websites, prototypes, logos, backgrounds or anything that can be created for both physical and digital media.
					<br><br>
					I've been working with Illustrator, InDesign and Photoshop for many (10+) years, and I've been expanding my knowledge of Premiere Pro, After Effects, Dreamweaver and XD during many projects the last few years.
					<br><br>
					On my iPad Pro I make portraits, logos, animations and many other types of drawings and designs in ProCreate for many projects, both professionally and for personal practice.
					<br><br>
					I've also used iMovie for many projects at different job positions, but I've been slowly replacing it with Premiere Rush.

					These are some of the projects I've been apart of during my time at EAAA.
					<br><br>
					I've made the logos, the pictures, the videos, the animations, the drawings, the background and the styletiles for all of them.
					<br><br>
					I've also been coding a heavy portion of most of them, and I've played an important part during the research phase as well.

					In 2018 I decided to work on my skillset in digital portraits.
					<br><br>
					I started off by doing minimal color and worked my way up with every portrait, until I made full color portraits.
					<br><br>
					The portraits are all made in ProCreate with some of my friends and family as models.

					In my sparetime I'm playing around with a comic concept called "BatDuck Comics".
					<br><br>
					It's a little four box comic concept about a runner duck and a bumblebee bat that are best friends.
					<br><br>
					The stories sometimes come to me out of nowhere, and then I spend the next week perfecting the idea and drawing the comic.
